Urban Green SARCA
==================

QGIS plugin for analysis of radioactive contamination of vegetation cover in (mostly) urban environment

**Description**

The Urban Green SARCA (USG) module is a GIS tool created for the purpose of
estimating the deposition of radionuclides on the surface of vegetation and
soil, or in areas without vegetation in the early phase of a radiation
accident. The module makes it possible to estimate the radioactive
contamination of the vegetation cover by means of satellite images, total
radioactivity deposition data and precipitation amount data during the
radiation accident. USG provides a “first view” on spatial information of a
radioactive contamination of vegetation and soils within large areas in a
very simple way and thus it is a usable tool for decision makers and
authorities in case of radiation accident. The usage of module is suitable
mostly for areas where the vegetation cover and amount of biomass is not very
well documented, e.g. urban areas.
