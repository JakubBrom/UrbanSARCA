 in (mostly) urban environment

about=The Urban Green SARCA (USG) module is a  GIS tool created for the
  purpose of estimating the deposition of radionuclides on the surface
  of vegetation and soil, or in areas without vegetation in the early
  phase of a radiation accident. The module makes it possible to
  estimate the radioactive contamination of the vegetation cover by
  means of satellite images, total radioactivity deposition data and
  precipitation amount data during the radiation accident. USG provides
  a “first sight” on spatial information of a radioactive contamination
  of vegetation and soils within large areas in a very simple way and
  thus it is a usable tool for decision makers and authorities in case
  of radiation accident. The usage of module is suitable mostly for
  areas where the vegetation cover and amount of biomass is not very
  well documented, e.g. urban areas.

  Outputs:
  - Amount of biomass (t/ha)
  - Interception factor
  - Biomass contamination (Bq/m2)
  - Soil contamination (Bq/m2)
  - Mass contamination (Bq/kg)
  - Mask of hygienic limit exceeding
  - Mask of reference levels

  QGIS module Urban Green SARCA development was supported by project of
  Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic No. VH20172020015
